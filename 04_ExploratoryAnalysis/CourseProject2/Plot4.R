# Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an ambient air pollutant for which there is strong evidence
# that it is harmful to human health. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency
# (EPA) is tasked with setting national ambient air quality standards for fine PM and for tracking
# the emissions of this pollutant into the atmosphere. Approximatly every 3 years, the EPA releases
# its database on emissions of PM2.5. This database is known as the National Emissions Inventory
# (NEI). You can read more information about the NEI at the EPA National Emissions Inventory web site
# (http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/eiinformation.html).

# For each year and for each type of PM source, the NEI records how many tons of PM2.5 were emitted
# from that source over the course of the entire year. The data that you will use for this assignment
# are for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
